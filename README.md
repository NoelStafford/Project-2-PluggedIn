# Project Title
PluggedIn

## Description

This project was designed to be a one stop shop for all your job finding needs and posting needs. The purpose was to have a website that would link all the job listings from major companies and put them into one place. The user would be able to create a profile and then sign in. The user would be able to search for jobs and click the job listings to be taken to them. If the user also wished they could post a job listing as well. Not only could the user post jobs but they could then delete the job posting once the position had been filled or chosen to update the listing as well if things changed.

While building this project I learned to:

- Connect routes to models and vice versa. We learned how to use handlebars and how they can be used as a replacement template for traditional HTML. We also learned how to create a database and seed data into the database. We learned the importance of having test data to be able to test things such as your routes. We learned about helpers and the purpose that they serve as well. 

### Built With

JavaScript, Handlebars, CSS, DBeaver, Express, MySQL, Node, Sequelize, Bcrypt, Fetch.
